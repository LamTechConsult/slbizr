App Issues
General
-App is Opened first time and user is not logged
--Show the splash screens

-App is Opened second or more times and user is already logged in the past
--Do not show the splash screens again. Take them to nearby  screen right away and capture their current location automatically

-Loading screen
--Make loading screen and a transparent overlay. I want user to continue seeing what they were looking at while the app is loading other screen

-Approved Domains or crossover domains
--Make sure users can crossover from obizr.io to the app and back.
--When a user visits obizr, show them the app download banner or ask them to open app if already installed
--When user click on a link like http://obizr.io/privacy-policy, take them to the mobile website using inapp browser with the back button available

-App orientation
--Lock app orientation to Portrait only. No landscape mode

-Local Storage/Caching
--Cache nearby view Json, Category, Keyword, Chiefdom dropdown options

-Offline Notification
--Change the background of header and add text (Offline)
--User that is already logged In should be able to continue browsing and using app but cannot make any post call
--If user is online but you are unable to get data from API, show friendly message.
--Add timeout when searching for data from Api
--Lets leverage local storage and store as much as we can locally and first choice for system should be to use local data
--While local data is display, we will fetch updates in the background and refresh the screen without the user noticing anything
--Search scope should start with local storage data first and if nothing is there, call Api to check
